# Process Iteration
The tools change our processes change our tools. Practicing adapting and readapting the workflow might yield some interesting results.

## Conscious Workflow Process
Have a working session and describe the flow of what's happening and how. Ask what tools would speed things up. Imagine working in different ways.

## Landscape Reappraisal
Look at the latest changes and notes to a set of comparable tools in a category (code editor, chat agent, MCP), see if there's something useful. Try them out speculatively.

## Social Tool Usage
Given an idea for something which might be useful (e.g. "chatgpt for travel planning"), host a little working session in which participants simultaneously try that thing, take notes on their experience and interaction, and those notes are collectively synthesized for themes, hints, and ideas. (Be an ant.)

## Take Notes on Surprises
Note the things you see that you didn't know were possible. Updating your models of reality happens more slowly than reality might be changing. Review this list frequently. Having it in mind may surface new ideas and combinatinos.
